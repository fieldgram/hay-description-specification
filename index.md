## Specification development status

This document is in draft form and sets forth on a preliminary basis the data fields, associated data types, and related values necessary to express the salient economic characteristics of hay for marketing purposes. The reader may think of the product definition as general, formal model of hay as a cash crop and the actual hay to be offered for sale in the market as "instances" of the model. The model assumes the perspectives both of the diligent buyer and the candid seller. It provides a structured means for expressing what would the buyer need to know in order to make a well-informed purchase and to be able to compare the product with others offered on the market, and what would a well-intentioned seller wish to convey about his product so that both he and his customer will enjoy a mutually-satisfying trade.

## Probable deficiencies

The preliminary definition lacks expressive capacity at this time for several practices and product features for which future elaboration may be desirable. These include details concerning herbicide and preservative applications, choice of sampling protocols, and several laboratory measures. To the extent users determine the product definition would be improved through addition or modification of fields to hold these values, it will be extended accordingly.
